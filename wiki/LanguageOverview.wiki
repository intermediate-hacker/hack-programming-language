= Introduction =

The *Hack Programming Language* is a JIT Compiled Programming Language, built on top of _C#_. It is actually a thin high-level functional paradigm layer on top of the _C#_ syntax. The compiler translates the *Hack* Source Code to readable C Sharp code, which can then either be directly compiled by any _C#_ compiler like the one packaged with Microsoft's .NET Framework, or Mono's implementation, or be included in an existing _C#_ Project.
