= Introduction =

The Hack Programming Language is a JIT Compiled Programming Language, built on top of C Sharp. It is actually a thin high-level functional paradigm layer on top of the C Sharp syntax. The compiler translates the Hack Source Code to readable C Sharp code, which can then either be directly compiled by a C Sharp compiler or be included in an existing C Sharp Project.
