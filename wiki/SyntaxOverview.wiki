#summary A brief walk-through of the syntax

= Introduction =

Hack has a simple syntax, a little similar to Lua , Python , Pascal and C#. 

==The 'Hello World' Example==
A simple hello world program in the hack programming language. I will explain things later on.
{{{
writeln "Hello World!"
}}}

A more comprehensive program:
{{{
var hello = "Hello World!"
writeln hello
readln
}}}

= Details =
==Expressions==
For now, you can't type more than one expression in a line, since the compiler differentiates expressions by '\n' instead of ';'.

==Variables==
Variables can be declared with the *var* keyword. For example:
{{{
var mystr = "This is a string!"
var mynum = 23
var mychr = 'H'
}}}

The variable type is determined by the compiler either at compile-time or at run-time, depending on the situation.

==Function Calls==
You can simple call functions by their name followed by their arguments separated by a ','. for example:
{{{
writeln "Hello World!"
readln
swap mystr1, mystr2
}}}

==Functions==
<to be implemented>

==Inline C# Code==
You can type inline C# code using the {{{#__csc__}}} and {{{#__end__}}} pre-processor directives. You can also use the local hack variables in the inline C# code. for example:
{{{
var m = "Hello!"
#__csc__
System.Windows.Forms.MessageBox.Show(m);
#__end__
writeln "I just used inline C Sharp!!!"
}}}
